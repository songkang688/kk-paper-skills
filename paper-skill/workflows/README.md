# Workflows

These workflow pages turn paper-skill's benchmarked capabilities into reusable modules.

| Workflow | Use it for |
|---|---|
| [literature-review](literature-review.md) | Related-work matrix, research-gap extraction, citation roles |
| [submission-package](submission-package.md) | Final title, abstract, cover letter, declarations, highlights, checklist |
| [figure-audit](figure-audit.md) | Figure-to-claim alignment, caption revision, missing evidence |
| [reference-tools](reference-tools.md) | Citation/reference matching, missing metadata, suspicious references |
| [full-verification](full-verification.md) | Crossref/OpenAlex, official policy evidence, and revision trace in one run |

Use these workflows together with the core modules in [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md).

For executable checks, see [tools/README.md](../tools/README.md) and run:

```bash
python tools/paper_skill_gate.py examples/submission-package-check.json
```
