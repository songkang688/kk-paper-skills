# Executable Toolchain

paper-skill is moving from a prompt-only library toward a verifiable submission workflow.

## What Runs Today

| Tool | Command | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Stage-gate checker | `python tools/paper_skill_gate.py examples/submission-package-check.json` | Checks whether a submission package has the minimum structure for paper-skill review |
| JSON report | `python tools/paper_skill_gate.py package.json --format json` | Emits results suitable for CI and other agents |
| Strict gate | `python tools/paper_skill_gate.py package.json --strict` | Treats unresolved warnings as a nonzero result |
| Full workflow | `python tools/run_full_workflow.py examples/full-workflow-config.json --output full-report.json` | Runs gates, references, journal-policy evidence, and revision trace |
| Public benchmark | `python tools/run_benchmark.py` | Replays transparent synthetic risk-classification cases |
| Unit tests | `python -m unittest discover -s tests` | Guards the checker behavior |

## Stage-Gate Philosophy

The checker follows the same editorial policy as the skill:

- Do not polish unsupported claims.
- Do not let citations float without claim links.
- Do not treat an English abstract as submission-ready until the source, evidence, cover letter, highlights, and declarations are visible.
- Mark missing facts before improving style.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Use `$paper-skill` to build a submission package draft.
2. Save the package as JSON using the shape in `examples/submission-package-check.json`.
3. Run the stage-gate checker.
4. Resolve every `FAIL` before asking for final polishing.
5. Treat every `WARN` as a human-review item.

## Scope boundary

The deterministic gate and public benchmark measure structured completeness and risk classification. They do not judge prose quality, novelty, or acceptance probability. Live DOI and policy verification require network access; record sources and access dates and keep failures visible as unverified.
